Protomak Engine

  The Protomak Engine component is in charge of transforming various integration technologies
  (such as XSDs, Jonas, etc) to .proto files. 
  
  Currently the only supported technology is XML Schemas. To find out how Protomak Engine transforms
  XSDs into proto files, please refer to the {{{./usage.html} Usage }} page.
